theauncient mathematiciens [a line]a _line_ is called the race or course of a _point_ a poynt we defineby the name of a thing mathematicall though it be no magnitude andindiuisible because it is the propre ende and bound of a line whichis a true _magnitude_ [magnitude]and _magnitude_ we may define to be that thing _mathematicall_ which isdiuisible for euer in partes diuisible long broade or

thatname contenteth me not whereof a word or two hereafter shall be saydhow immateriall and free from all matter _number_ is who doth notperceaue yea who doth not wonderfully wder at it for neither

{x} and 3 the degree of the thing in lessequtitie and with all {x} being alwayes in a certaine middellbetwene the two heigthes or degrees for the first difference i set4{x} and for the second i set {x}3 and now againe i say as is to 2 so is 4{x} to {x}3 wherfore of these foure proportionallnumbers the first and the fourth multiplied one by the other do makeas much as the second and the third multiplied the one by the otherlet these multiplications be made accordingly and of the first and thefourth we haue {x}3 and of the second & the third 2{x} wherforeour quation is betwene {x}3 and 2{x} which may be reducedaccording to the arte of algiebar as here adding 3 to eche partgeueth the quation thus {x}=2{x} and yet againe contracting orreducing it adde to eche part 2{x} then haue you 3{x} quall to thus represented 3{x}= wherefore diuiding by 3 the quotient is32/3 the _valew_ of our {x} _coss_ or _thing_ first supposed andthat is the heigth or intension of the _forme resulting_ which is_heate_ in two thirdes of the fourth degree and here i set the shew ofthe worke in conclusion thus the proufe hereof is easie bysubtracting 3 from 32/3 resteth 2/3 subtracte the same heigth of theforme resulting which is 32/3 fr 4 then resteth /3 you see that 2/3 isdouble to /3 as 2{p} is double to {p} so should it be by the rulehere geuen note as you added to eche part of the quation 3 so if yefirst added to eche part 2{x} it would stand 3{x}3= and now addingto eche part 3 you haue as afore 3{x}= _________________________ | | | _ | {p} _2_ | _hote 4_ | /3 _ _the forme_ | | | _ _32/3
